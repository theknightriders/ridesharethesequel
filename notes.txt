Profile Page work:

Profile Information:
1) Make the Edit Profile button change user's information to form elements.
2) Have the buttons all disappear while the information is editable.
3) When information is editable, a submit button needs to appear.
4) When the submit button is pressed, it should post all of the new information to the database, overwriting whatever else was there.
5) Also, when the submit button is pressed, the information should become text again, and the buttons should reappear.

Change Password:

2) Validate old email with database,
3) Validate new email (make sure the two match)
4) Post new password to database when Submit Change button is pressed
