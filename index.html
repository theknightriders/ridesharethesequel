There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

                      I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Trees grow however makes them happy. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Be brave. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. You are only limited by your imagination. Do an almighty painting with us.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      You can do it. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Fluff that up. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      Let's get crazy. With practice comes confidence. Only eight colors that you need. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
